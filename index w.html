<h2>Welcome to secand page</h2>
<h2>Today we are going to do a maths question</h2>
<h2>do you know how to canvert mixed number in to an inproper number?</h2>
<h2>For example 3 5/2 how to canvert it in to an inproper number,</h2>
<h2>to canvert it you have to multiply 2(denominator) by 3(whole number) = 6,</h2>
<h2>now add 5(numerator) in the answer 6 = 11,</h2>
<h2>now replace 5(numerator) by the answer 11 and 2(denominator) will remain as same,</h2>
<h2>the answer is 11/2,</h2>
<h2>as you can see the 11/2 in the answer the numerator is bigger than denominator so now it is an inproper number.</h2>
<h1>Thanks.</h1>
